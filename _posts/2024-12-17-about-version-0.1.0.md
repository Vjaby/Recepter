### The First Release

Releases have to start happening at some point and for this app, it's now.
The app works. There are many things to fix, change and improve but this is a good starting point.

#### What works now
- The very basics of the app
- Three languages - Czech, English, German

<br>

#### What's coming
- Bug fixes (there's sure to be loads of them)
- Better placeholders - when opening the app, what shows up in the lists
- Opening the app with files - when you drag a recipie file onto Receper.exe it should open. Of course also when double clicking on the file or using Open with... -> Recepter
- Opening file by draging them onto the (running) app
- Icons!
- Checks - so it's not possible to do something dumb
- Update localization files
