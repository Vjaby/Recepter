The first update for Recepter is here.

#### What's new
- Icons! - made 'em myself (don't expect quality)
- Opening the app with files - when you drag a recipe file onto Receper.exe it opens. Of course also when double clicking on the file or using Open with... -> Recepter
- Also you can now drag and drop a recipe onto the window to open it.
- Updated the localization files.

#### What's coming
- Custom file extension
